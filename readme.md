An entry to Ludum Dare 19: Discovery
------------------------------------

Developed using Ruby 1.9.2 and Gosu 0.7.25 so try to have recent versions.
You should be able to run the game with two simple steps:
# `gem install gosu` if you don't already have gosu 
# `ruby main.rb`

This is a work in progress. Everything is provided as-is, no guarentees.
